## Note
This project is currently under construction and will be completed in the coming days. Please check back soon for updates. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at ntasso@fi.uba.ar. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

## GIFs in Some_examples/Undergraduate folder

The files located in the "undergraduate" folder are intended to provide undergraduate students with an illustration of stress paths for different soil types. The GIFs were created using different models, including OCclay, NorSand, and HS-Small. Please note that the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope shown in the GIFs is not an accurate representation of the yield surface of the models, but rather a simplified schematic representation for instructional purposes only.

We hope that these files will be helpful for students who are learning about soil mechanics and stress paths. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact us.
